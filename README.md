# QmlFlightInstruments
This project is a QML port of [Marek M. Cel](http://marekcel.pl/)'s work [QFlightinstruments](https://github.com/marek-cel/QFlightinstruments).

All SVG files are taken from Marek's repository. Copyright notice is under `Resources` folder. For the details, please visit his repository.

## Build
Simply open `QmlFlightInstruments.pro` with QtCreator and build it. I used Qt 5.15.2, but other versions greater than Qt 5.15 should also work. 
The project contains a QML application in which you can get an insight on how to use this project for your needs.
